# MyJFQL

MyJFQL is an open source database management system for short dmbs. With this DMBS you can manage your database. It runs
on all operating systems on which Java 11 is installed. MyJFQL uses JFQL as a language and not like most other SQL. JFQL
is similar to SQL but is very simplified.

### Features

* MyJFQL is very fast and resource saving as it was written in java
* You can write modules for MyJFQL with which you can completely customize the DBMS
* There is support for many languages such as JavaScript, Java and Python
* If your language is not directly supported, you can simply write your own connector with an HTTP client and Json.
